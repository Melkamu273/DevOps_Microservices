###### Kubernetes Housing Price Machine Learning Based Predictor. 


## Project Overview 
This project operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API.It uses machine learning to forecast home price trends. The project has been created as a Docker image, which can be quickly deployed as a microservice in Kubernetes or Docker using a YAML configuration file the kubectl or docker command line utility, as appropriate.The service exposes a prediction call endpoint once it has been implemented. 

### How to run the Project 
The Algorithm used is a pretrained model.
The model data directory contains the model data and the pretrained model.
app.py contains a Flask app definition that, when called, services the prediction model on an endpoint. The project tested by using  linting and containerize using  Dockerfile. then next deploy containerized application using Docker and make a prediction.
 
 it also  Deploy with Kubernetes to do this 
 * Configure Kubernetes and create a Kubernetes cluster
 * Deploy a container using Kubernetes and make a prediction
 To test the project Build it is integrated with CircleCI 

## Running the Prediction Service 
To run the project, a Makefile has been added which contains the basic commands needed to setup the environment running.
To run you have to create a virtual environment by running the make command below:
#   For Linux

        python3 -m venv ~/.devops
        source ~/.devops/bin/activate
        make install
        python app.py
#    For Windows

        python -m venv /.devops
        /.devops/Scripts/activate
        make install
        python app.py
##  Running with Docker
Before run with docker it is recommended that you make lint to run lint checks on the project code. to check all requirements should be satisfied, and you should see a printed statement that rates your code.
  ./run_docker.sh
## Running with Kubernetes
before you use the command below you should Configure Kubernetes. after  uploaded a docker image and configured Kubernetes so that a cluster is running.youâ€™ll be able to deploy your application on the Kubernetes cluster. This involves running your containerized application using kubectl, which is a command line interface for interacting with Kubernetes clusters is  
 ./run_kubernetes.sh          

## CI/CD

This project integrates CircleCI for CI/CD. The CircleCI configuration file, config.yml  found inside .circleci directory. The file CircleCI is looks into for instructions on what to do in the Pipeline.
